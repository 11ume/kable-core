> Some rules im implement as a code of conduct, to write this code.

* Avoid the use of reserved word **this**.

* Always make **[clean code](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)**.

* If a line or block of code needs to be commented, it is because it is very complex or the code is not eloquent.

* Try to make pure functions whenever you can.

* Try to make small functions that only  meet a simple task, this will make the event loop work better.

* You don't create classes, you don't need them, you don't need so much verbiage.

* Implement allways instead of inherit.

* Reduces the coercion between modules.

* Refactor the code every time you can.

* Don't make elegant code, the code too elegant can be difficult to understand for others.

* Others.
